The D&D Character Manager is an online means to manage player characters from 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons. Users will be able to store their characters with information such as the character's name, level, race, class, and any additional notes. Users will be able to create entries for these characters and modify the information they initially entered.

This project is currently a work in progress; development began in August 2017 and continues to this day. The project was conceptualized as means for me to practice server-side web development in PHP in a setting reminescent of my favorite table-top RPG. With this, I am becoming familiar with database storage and access through the MySQL system. Development began with simple user account creation. Currently, users are able to log in and access pre-created characters. Development is predicted to finish in September 2017.
